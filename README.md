This project creates a personal AI assistant that runs entirely on your own computer. Unlike typical AI tools, it can look up live information on the internet in real time to give you up-to-date answers. It does this privately, without sending your data to the cloud, using a special tool called MCP that helps the AI safely browse websites.
